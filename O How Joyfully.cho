O how joyfully,
O how blessedly,
Comes the glory of Christmas time!
To a world so lost in sin,
Christ the Savior enters in:
Praise Him, all ye Christians
praise Him evermore!
 
O how joyfully,
O how blessedly,
Comes the glory of Christmas time!
Jesus, born in lowly stall
With His grace redeems us all:
Praise Him, all ye Christians
praise Him evermore!

O how joyfully,
O how blessedly,
Comes the glory of Christmas time!
Hosts of angels from on high
Sing, rejoicing, in the sky:
Praise Him, all ye Christians
praise Him evermore!
