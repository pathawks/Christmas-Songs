German:
[G]Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht, 
[D7]Alles schl√§ft; [G]einsam wacht
[C]Nur das traute [G]hochheilige Paar. 
[C]Holder Knabe im [G]lockigen Haar, 
[D]Schlaf in himmlischer [G]Ruh! 
Schlaf in [D7]himmlischer [G]Ruh!

[G]Silent night, holy night!
[D7]All is calm, [G]all is bright
[C]Round yon virgin [G]Mother and Child.
[C]Holy Infant so [G]tender and mild,
[D]Sleep in heavenly [G]peace,
Sleep in [D7]heavenly [G]peace!

[G]Silent night, holy night!
[D7]Shepherds quake [G]at the sight;
[C]Glories stream from [G]heaven afar,
[C]Heavenly hosts sing [G]alleluia,
[D]Christ, the Savior is [G]born!
Christ, the [D7]Savior is [G]born!

[G]Silent night, holy night!
[D7]Son of God, [G]love's pure light
[C]Radiant beams from [G]Thy holy face,
[C]With the dawn of re[G]deeming grace,
[D]Jesus, Lord, at Thy [G]birth,
Jesus, [D7]Lord, at Thy [G]birth.
