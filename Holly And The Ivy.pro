Verse 1:
The holly and the ivy,
Now both are full well grown,
Of all the trees within the wood,
The holly bears the crown.

{soc}
O the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir. 

Verse 2:
The holly bears a blossom,
As white as any flow'r,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To be our sweet Savior.

Verse 3:
The holly bears a berry,
As red as any blood,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To do poor sinners good.

Verse 4:
The holly bears a prickle,
As sharp as any thorn,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
On Christmas Day in the morn.

Verse 5:
The holly bears a bark,
As bitter as the gall,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
For to redeem us all.
