[D]Angels [F#m]we have [A7]heard on [D]high,
[D]Sweetly singing [A7]o'er the [D]plains,
And the [F#m]mountains [A7]in re[D]ply
Echo back their [A7]joyous [D]strains.

[D]Glo[B7][Em7][A][D][G]­[A]ria [D]in ex[G]celsis [F#]De[A]o
[D]Glo[B7][Em7][A][D][G]­[A]ria [D]in ex[G]celsis [D]De[A]­[D]o

[D]Shepherds, [F#m]why this [A7]jubi[D]lee?
[D]Why your joyous [A7]strains pro[D]long?
What the [F#m]gladsome [A7]tidings [D]be,
Which inspire your [A7]heav'nly [D]song?

[D]Come to [F#m]Bethle[A7]hem and [D]see
[D]Him whose birth the [A7]angels [D]sing;
Come a[F#m]dore on [A7]bended [D]knee
Christ, the Lord, the [A7]newborn [D]King.
