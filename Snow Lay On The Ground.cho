Verse 1:
The snow lay on the ground,
The stars shone bright,
When Christ our Lord was born
On Christmas night.
Venite adoremus
Dominum;
Venite adoremus
Dominum.

{soc}
Venite adoremus Dominum;
Venite adoremus Dominum.
{eoc}

Verse 2:
'Twas Mary, daughter pure
Of holy Anne,
That brought into this world
The God made man.
She laid him in a stall
At Bethlehem;
The ass and oxen shared
The roof with them.

Verse 3:
Saint Joseph, too, was by
To tend the child;
To guard Him and protect
His mother mild.
The angels hovered 'round,
And sang this song:
Venite adoremus
Dominum.

Verse 4:
And thus that manger poor
Became a throne,
For He whom Mary bore
Was God the Son.
O come, then, let us join
The heav'nly host,
To praise the Father, Son,
And Holy Ghost.
