Verse 1:
[G]Angels, from the realms of glory,
[C]Wing your [G]flight o'er [D]all the [G]earth;
[G]Ye, who sang creation's [Em/B]sto[B]ry,
[Em]Now proclaim Mes[A]siah's [D]birth:

{soc}
[D]Come and worship,
[G]Come and [C]worship,
[Am]Worship [C]Christ, the [D]newborn [G]King
{eoc}

Verse 2:
[G]Shepherd's in the field abiding,
[C]Watching [G]o'er your [D]flocks by [G]night;
[G]God with man is now re[Em/B]si[B]ding,
[Em]Yonder shines the [A]infant [D]light:

Verse 3:
[G]Sages, leave your contemplations,
[C]Brighter [G]visions [D]beam a[G]far;
[G]Seek the great Desire of [Em/B]na[B]tions,
[Em]Ye have seen His [A]natal [D]star:

[Em]to th'eternal [A]Three in [D]One.
